# Settings here are added to the combined build settings, after all basic
# settings, to allow you to override anything you need to.  They can in turn
# be overriden by user settings and project settings respectively.
#
# Typically you want to prepend to one of the settings listed to expand your
# paths, but you can also append, override, or remove settings.
#
# NOTE: At some point this file will allow you to have multiple site settings
# to select between.  For now there is only the "site" settings.
